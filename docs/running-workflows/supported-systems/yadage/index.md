# Yadage

The Yadage workflow system has been developed in the context of experimental
particle physics with the aim to facilitate systematic reinterpretation of
experimental data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN. The Yadage engine orchestrates the execution of containerised data
analysis workloads expressed as Directed Acyclic Graphs. Yadage comes with
physics-oriented declarative programming paradigms such as dynamic
multi-cascading scatter-gather that are useful for the "embarrassingly
parallel" nature of experimental particle physics workloads.
