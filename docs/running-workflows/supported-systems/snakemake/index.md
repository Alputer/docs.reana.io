# Snakemake

Snakemake is a popular workflow management system originated in bioinformatics in 2012, for
reproducible and scalable data analyses. It describes workflows via a readable, Python-based
language, and allows them to be scaled without the need for modifications.

Snakemake workflows can describe the software required to run them, which is automatically
deployed in any execution environment.

For additional information, see [Snakemake Documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io).
