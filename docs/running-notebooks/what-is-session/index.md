# What is a session?

Alongside running batch computational workflows, the REANA platform allows users to open interactive sessions (such as [Jupyter notebooks based](../opening-sessions#jupyter-notebooks-based-sessions)) on the same workspace.

The opened sessions will have access to the workflow workspace, allowing users to modify the analysis and its assets and quickly debug common problems.
