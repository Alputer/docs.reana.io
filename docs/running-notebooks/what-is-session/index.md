# What is a session?

Alongside running batch computational workflows, the REANA platform
allows users to open interactive sessions (such as
[Jupyter notebooks](../opening-sessions#jupyter-notebooks-based-sessions))
based on the same workspace.

The opened sessions will have access to the workflow workspace, allowing
users to modify the analysis and its assets, to run interactive code to
explore the produced data on the workspace, or to open a terminal
session on the workflow workspace in order to debug problems.
