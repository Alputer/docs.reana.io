# Next steps

After getting familiarised with REANA, here are possible next steps that you
can take to get a deeper understanding of the system.

Firstly, you should explore dedicated tutorials for the declarative workflow
language you would like to use. For example:

- [CWL user guide](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/)
- [Snakemake tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html)

REANA aims at providing a platform for running these workflows seamlessly, so
getting acquainted with the possibilities of the workflow system is important
in order to take the full advantage of the paradigm.

Secondly, you may want to explore [several existing REANA analysis
examples](https://github.com/reanahub?q=demo) on GitHub to see how typical data
analyses may be containerised and run as automated workflows.

Finally, you can read other dedicated documentation sections on this web site
for particular topics of interest. For example, if you would like to run
Jupyter notebooks alongside your workflows, please see [Running
notebooks](/running-notebooks/) on this web site.
